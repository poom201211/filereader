# Filereader
This project is focused on writing and experimenting with a Stopwatch class I wrote. This class can be used in many ways but, in this task I used it to test how fast a file could be read.

Classes: \n
*StringInputStream* - Used to read a file using InputStream(Class) into a String.\n
*StringBuilderInputStream* - Used to read a file using InputStream(Class) into a StringBuilder.\n
*StringBufferReader* - Used to read a file using BufferReader(Class) into a String.\n
