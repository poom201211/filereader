# Filereader
This project is focused on writing and experimenting with a Stopwatch class I wrote. This class can be used in many ways but, in this task I used it to test how fast a file could be read.

## Classes

StopWatch - Contains methods to start,stop and get elapse of time. 

Tasks - Super class of the classes highlighted in bold and implements interface *Runnable*.

**StringInputStream** - Used to read a file using InputStream(Class) into a String.

**StringBuilderInputStream** - Used to read a file using InputStream(Class) into a StringBuilder.

**StringBufferReader** - Used to read a file using BufferReader(Class) into a String.

## Interface

Runnable - Interface that contains the method *run()*, which the task class implements.
